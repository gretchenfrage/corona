//! A module for wildcard import.
//!
//! This contains some traits and general types that are meant to be wildcard imported. These are
//! extension traits, attaching more methods to existing types.
//!
//! Each of the main `futures` trait has one extension crate here. Also, the
//! [`Coroutine`](../coroutine/struct.Coroutine.html) is included, as the main type of the library.
//!
//! All of these things are internally delegated to the
//! [`Coroutine::wait`](../coroutine/struct.Coroutine.html#method.wait) method and are mostly for
//! convenience.
